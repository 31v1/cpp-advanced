🧊 Polar Aerospace Operations Base — Technical Training Module III
--

After mastering foundational and intermediate systems, Belyy Ursov now enters the advanced stage of training. This module focuses on complex program design, optimization, and systems integration — skills required for high‑level operations inside the facility.

The tone remains industrial and professional, with Belyy Ursov demonstrating discipline and endurance. The Plush Division (Pusa seal‑42 and Erignathus Nula‑09) continues to provide silent morale support, observing from their shelf as Ursov tackles increasingly abstract programming challenges.

This stage represents Ursov’s transition from trainee to primary operator, capable of designing robust systems under extreme Arctic conditions.
This module introduces:

* Advanced data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues)

* Algorithmic problem solving (sorting, searching, recursion)

* Memory management and optimization

* Modular system architecture

* Simulation of complex base operations
