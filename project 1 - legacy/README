# Legacy Version

This is the original version of the water consumption billing project created for Programming I.

It is preserved exactly as it was originally written, including:
- all logic inside `main()`
- minimal modularization
- early attempts at input validation
- initial coding style and structure

This version is kept for historical and academic purposes, and to contrast with the refactored version.
